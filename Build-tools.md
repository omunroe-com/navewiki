* **tdreyno**'s [Middleman](http://github.com/tdreyno/middleman) — a lightweight framework built on Sinatra that serves lives Haml, Sass and CoffeeScript during development, then compiles, concatenates and minifies them for you when you're ready to deploy.

* Haml: **paulnicholson**'s [coffee-haml-filter](https://github.com/paulnicholson/coffee-filter) — a custom filter for rendering CoffeeScript inline within Haml templates.
