# CoffeeScript build tools

* **tdreyno**'s [Middleman](http://github.com/tdreyno/middleman) — a lightweight framework built on Sinatra that serves lives Haml, Sass and CoffeeScript during development, then compiles, concatenates and minifies them for you when you're ready to deploy.

* Haml: **inem** and **gerad**'s [coffee-haml-filter](http://github.com/gerad/coffee-haml-filter) — a custom filter for rendering CoffeeScript inline within Haml templates.

* Java: **yeungda**'s [JCoffeeScript](http://github.com/yeungda/jcoffeescript) — uses Rhino to compile CoffeeScript, allowing compilation within Java projects or on systems that Node.js doesn't support.
