# CoffeeScript build tools

* **tdreyno**'s [Middleman](http://github.com/tdreyno/middleman) — a lightweight framework built on Sinatra that serves lives Haml, Sass and CoffeeScript during development, then compiles, concatenates and minifies them for you when you're ready to deploy.

* Haml: **inem** and **gerad**'s [coffee-haml-filter](http://github.com/gerad/coffee-haml-filter) — a custom filter for rendering CoffeeScript inline within Haml templates.

* Java: **yeungda**'s [JCoffeeScript](http://github.com/yeungda/jcoffeescript) — uses Rhino to compile CoffeeScript, allowing compilation within Java projects or on systems that Node.js doesn't support.

* Java: **Web Resource Optimizer for Java** [wro4j] (https://github.com/alexo/wro4j) - uses Rhino for compilation of coffeeScript. Provides a runtime solution (using servlet filter), build time solution (maven plugin) and a command line tool. 

* **johtso**'s [CoffeeMarklet](http://johtso.github.com/CoffeeMarklet/) — a simple tool that allows you to quickly generate bookmarklets from CoffeeScript.

* **jtmueller**'s [CoffeeScript Monitor](http://coffeemonitor.codeplex.com/) - a Windows system tray app that monitors one or more folders for new or changed CoffeeScript files, displaying any compiler errors in a system tray balloon tip.
