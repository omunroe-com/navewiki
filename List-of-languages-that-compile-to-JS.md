#### CoffeeScript Family (& Friends)

* [[CoffeeScript|http://coffeescript.com]] Unfancy JavaScript
* [[Coco|https://github.com/satyr/coco]] a CoffeeScript dialect that aims to be more radical and practical, also acts as a test bed for features that get imported in CoffeeScript.
* [[Parsec CoffeeScript|https://github.com/fab13n/parsec-coffee-script]] is CS based on parser combinators. The project's aim is to add static metaprogramming (i.e. macros + syntax extensibility) to Coffee Script (CS), similar to how Metalua adds such features to Lua. The resulting compiler, once merged with the official compiler, should be usable as a drop-in replacement for it.
* [[Kaffeine|https://github.com/weepy/kaffeine]] Enhanced Syntax for Javascript.

#### Ruby, Python

* [[HotRuby|http://hotruby.yukoba.jp/]] runs opcode, compiled by YARV on Ruby inside a web browser or in Flash.
* [[rb2js|http://rb2js.rubyforge.org/]] converts Ruby to JavaScript.
* [[Red|https://github.com/jessesielaff/red]] writes like Ruby and runs like JavaScript

* [[Pyjamas|http://pyjs.org/]] Python to JS.

#### Lisp, Scheme

* [[Parenscript|http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/]] subset of Common Lisp to JS.
* [[ClojureScript|https://github.com/clojure/clojure-contrib/tree/master/clojurescript]] translates code written in a very small
subset of Clojure.
* [[Moby Scheme|https://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme]] a Scheme running in JS.
* [[Sibilant|http://sibilantjs.info]] Javascript with a lisp

#### Multitarget

* [[Haxe|http://haxe.org/]] compiles to several platforms (C++, Flash, JS, Neko, PHP).
* [[Clue|http://cluecc.sourceforge.net/]] C language compiler to different runtimes (Lua, JS, Perl 5, C, Java, CL).

#### Others

* [[Objective J|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-J]] shares with JavaScript the same relationship that Objective-C has with the C programming language: that of being a strict, but small, superset.
* [[Clamato|http://clamato.net/]] a Smalltalk dialect that is designed to operate within the JavaScript runtime.

* [[Flapjax|http://flapjax-lang.org/]] Event-driven, reactive evaluation.
* [[Ur|http://impredicative.com/ur/]] Haskell-like.
* [[Jack|https://github.com/creationix/jack]] Making programming playful.

* [[MileScript|http://milescript.org/]]  a strongly-typed language similar to C# and Java, but which compiles to JS.
* [[GWT|http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/]] Java to JS.
