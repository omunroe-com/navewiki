# The CoffeeScript Wiki

This wiki is a work-in-progress containing some useful lists and how-tos on advanced CoffeeScript topics. It does not contain authoritative documentation on the language. If you're just getting started with CoffeeScript, the best free resource is [[the official site|http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/]]. There are also several books: [Programming in Coffeescript](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/-/9780132946155), [The Little Book on CoffeeScript](http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/), [Smooth CoffeeScript](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/), and [[CoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development|http://pragprog.com/titles/tbcoffee/coffeescript]].

For general discussions and questions about CoffeeScript, see the [[Google Group|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coffeescript]] or the Freenode IRC room [[#coffeescript|http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=coffeescript]]. [[Stack Overflow|http://stackoverflow.com/tags/coffeescript]] is also a great resource; questions tagged `coffeescript` there are usually answered within a few hours. To file a bug report, use the [[issue tracker|https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues]].
